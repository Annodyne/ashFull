     <p><strong>Myelofibrosis</strong> (MF) is a clonal hematologic neoplasm characterized by bone marrow fibrosis, splenomegaly, anemia, and debilitating constitutional symptoms. Currently, the majority of patients (pts) without overt splenomegaly or disease-related symptoms or cytosis are managed through a “watch and wait” strategy treating only when signs of the disease present. However, recent evidence has suggested that pts with high molecular risk (HMR) mutations (ASXL1, EZH2, SRSF2, and IDH1/2) experience a more aggressive form of disease (Guglielmelli et al, Leukemia 2014). This subset of pts might be candidates for earlier intervention. Ruxolitinib (Rux), a JAK1/2 inhibitor approved in advanced MF, has been shown to improve symptoms and splenomegaly, and prolong survival in two phase 3 COMFORT studies (Verstovsek et al, Haematologica 2015; Cervantes et al, Blood 2013). The ReTHINK study investigates the potential benefits of Rux in pts with early non-symptomatic MF who harbor at least 1 HMR mutation and for whom Rux is currently not used.</p>
	 <p><strong>Methods:</strong> The ReTHINK study is a multicenter, randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study investigating the efficacy and safety of Rux (10 mg twice daily) in early MF pts with HMR mutations. The planned enrollment is 320 pts. Key inclusion criteria, in addition to a mutation in at least 1 of 5 HMR genes, include criteria for early MF with nonpalpable spleen or palpable spleen ≤ 5 cm and MF 7-item symptom scale (MF-7) score of ≤ 15 (with each individual symptom score of ≤ 3). Prior treatment with Rux or other JAK inhibitors, eligibility for allogeneic stem cell transplantation, inadequate liver function, and severely impaired renal function are key exclusion criteria. Primary objective is to evaluate the clinical benefit of Rux in delaying progression of MF from early disease to more advanced disease stages. Primary analysis will be performed at 90 progression free survival (PFS-1) events as assessed via the protocol defined criteria for disease progression. Secondary objectives include evaluation of PFS beyond the first occurrence of disease progression (PFS-2), time to progression, change in spleen length and volume from baseline, change in symptoms using MF-7 and EuroQOL-5D-5L (EQ-5D), pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability, and overall survival (NCT02598297).</p>
