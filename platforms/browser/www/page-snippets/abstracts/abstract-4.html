     <p><strong>Background: </strong>Pts with PV can have profound symptom burdens that impair QoL. Historical treatments have not demonstrated QoL improvement. The REVEAL study describes disease burden, PV management, and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) for US pts with PV. This updated and expanded analysis presents PROs for currently enrolled pts (data cutoff, 13 Nov 2015).</p>
	 <p><strong>Methods: </strong>REVEAL is a prospective, observational study enrolling adults (≥18 years [y]) with PV.  PROs are collected at enrollment and every 3 mo via the 10-item Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form (MPN SAF; score 0 [absent] to 10 [worst]); total symptom score (TSS; 0&mdash;100); 30-item EORTC Cancer QoL Questionnaire&mdash;Core 30 (EORTC QLQ C30; score 0&mdash;100 in 3 categories, higher score = better QoL, higher level of functioning, and worse symptom severity); and the Work Productivity &amp; Activity Impairment Specific Health Problem questionnaire (WPAI-SHP; score 0% [minimal/no impairment] to 100% [maximal impairment/productivity loss]). </p>
	 <p><strong>Results: </strong>1687 pts were enrolled: 54% men, 89.5% white, median age 67 y. 1552 pts completed questionnaires at enrollment. MPN-SAF moderate to severe (score ≥4) symptoms were reported for 72.8% of pts. Mean (SD) symptom scores were highest for fatigue 3.5 (2.7), night sweats 1.8 (2.7), early satiety 2.6 (2.7), inactivity 2.6 (2.8), itching 2.4 (3.0), and concentration problems 2.1 (2.6); mean (SD) MPN SAF TSS was 19.1 (15.7). <br>
	 <br>
	Mean (SD) global health status/QoL reported on the EORTC QLQ C30 was 73.2 (23.4); functional subscales were as follows: cognitive 80.7 (24.2); emotional 80.9 (23.8); physical 83.5 (19.8); role 85.0 (25.2); and social 85.7 (24.3). Of 575 pts employed at enrollment, mean (SD) PV-related WPAI SHP scores were absenteeism 3.0% (11.9%); presenteeism 12.2% (20.8%); work productivity loss (absenteeism and presenteeism) 13.6% (22.5%); and activity impairment 19.6% (26.6%).</p>
	 <p><strong>Conclusion: </strong>Patients enrolled in REVEAL have high symptom burdens leading to notable physical and emotional QoL impairment and considerable work productivity loss due to PV. Longitudinal PRO assessments in REVEAL can help examine QoL changes over time and should be used in routine clinical practice.</p>
