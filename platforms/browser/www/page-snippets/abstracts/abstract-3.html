     <p><strong>Background: </strong>Limited real-world data exist about the burden of PV and treatment patterns in the US. REVEAL describes burden of disease, clinical management of PV, and patient-reported outcomes for US pts with PV. </p>
	 <p><strong>Methods: </strong>REVEAL is a prospective, observational study enrolling adults ≥18 years (y) with PV. Disease/clinical characteristics, treatment patterns, and patient-reported outcomes data are collected at usual-care visits over a 36-mo period. This updated analysis describes physician-reported disease/clinical characteristics and treatment patterns of currently enrolled pts (data cutoff, 13 Nov 2015).</p>
	 <p><strong>Results: </strong>1687 pts were enrolled from 191 sites (academic n=28; community n=163). The primary methods of PV diagnosis were elevated Hgb, +JAK2V617F test, and low serum EPO level. Elevated WBC and platelets, and splenomegaly led to diagnosis in 19.9%, 29.3%, and 6.9% of pts, respectively. 44.1% of pts had ≥1 symptom that led to diagnosis; the most common symptoms were fatigue 21.7%, pruritus 13.1%, muscle aches/bone pain 8.4%, insomnia 5.7%, and night sweats 5.2%. 11.4% of pts had a history of thrombotic events (TE) at diagnosis. 5.9% had a family history of PV.<br>
	 <br>
	 At enrollment, median age was 67 y, 54% were male, 89.5% were white, 45.6% had smoked, 51.4% were retired, 32.6% were employed, and 4.3% were unable to work/disabled. Median disease duration was 4.3 y; 18.4% of pts were diagnosed <1 y and 41.0% were diagnosed >5 y before study entry. Mean hematocrit was 44.8%, Hgb was 14.4 g/dL, WBC count was 10.6×10<sup>9</sup>/L, and platelet count was 782.8×10<sup>9</sup>/L. At enrollment, 19.4% had a history of TE; 11.3% and 9.2% had ≥1 venous or arterial TE. The most common symptoms were fatigue 36.7%, pruritus 23.5%, headache 17.3%, insomnia 16.8%, dizziness 13.5%, dyspnea 12.9%, and bone pain 11.4%. Of pts who had spleen palpation data, 19.0% had splenomegaly. The most common PV treatments ± aspirin were phlebotomy (PHL, 32.1%), hydroxyurea (HU, 28.2%), and PHL + HU (24.5%). </p>
	 <p><strong>Conclusion: </strong>These data show that pts had a high symptom burden and TE rate at diagnosis that remained high at enrollment. Longitudinal data from REVEAL can provide better understanding of disease continuum, complications, and consequences of PV.</p>
